Hi Aurelius, 
 
yes you get it. Simply calling machine learning models does not help.

Dear Prof,  
 
Ah I understand. So although we can use machine learning to aid our process for 
completing the problem. Its the code behind it, how we structure them how we connect it 
to each other and whether they make logical sense.  
 
In that case, even a machine learning model is not really useful and you would rather see a 
properly implemented (from my own understanding) an example, a dictionary or linked 
lists to aid in the risk scoring function.  
 
Do let me know if that's the case. Thank you so much and sorry for always 
spamming/troubling you T_T.

Hi Aurelius,
 
I think it is good enough, although a little bit too complex to me. I think you still emphasis 
on applying the machine learning models, actually we should focus on the using data 
structures like dictionary, tree, linked lists etc. so please submit first, and we can discuss 
more later.

Dear Prof, 
Hi Prof, I have done a draft of the document for my group based on our discussion recently. 
Do let me know if this is alright? Or if you have any comments ?? 
 
If any issues, do let me know I will relay it to the team haha. Thanks a lot!
Warm Regards,
